# Philosophers Program Bugfix Documentation

## Issue Description

The Philosophers program was experiencing a hanging issue when a philosopher died. The program would detect the death correctly and print the death status message, but it would not terminate properly.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root issue was in the death handling mechanism:

1. The `death_monitor` thread correctly detected a death and signaled the parent process using a semaphore.
2. However, there was no proper mechanism for the death detection to propagate to the main philosopher process routine.
3. When using a direct `exit(1)` call in the death_monitor thread, the program would terminate without proper cleanup, causing memory leaks.
4. Without an exit call, the program would hang indefinitely.
5. Even with proper death flag checking in child processes, there was still an intermittent hang issue due to the parent process not forcefully terminating all child processes.
6. The final hang issue was due to the parent process blocking indefinitely in the `wait()` call, even after killing the child processes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Process ID Tracking in Philosopher Structure

Modified `philo_routine` to store each philosopher's process ID, which allows other functions to identify the current philosopher:

```c
void philo_routine(t_philo *philo)
{
    pthread_t monitor;
    
    // Store process ID to identify this philosopher in other functions
    philo->pid = getpid();
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

### 2. Modified Death Detection in Main Philosopher Loop

Added a death check at the beginning of the main loop in `philo_routine`:

```c
while(1)
{
    // Check death flag at the beginning of each iteration
    // This allows for proper cleanup before exit
    if (philo->death)
    {
        clean(philo->data);
        exit(1);
    }
    // ... rest of the loop
}
```

### 3. Modified Death Monitor Thread

Changed the `death_monitor` thread to set a flag and break instead of directly exiting:

```c
void *death_monitor(void *arg)
{
    // ... existing code
    if (time_since_last_meal >= philo->data->time_to_die)
    {
        philo->death = 1;
        print_status(philo, DIED);
        sem_post(philo->data->dead);
        // Just break instead of exit to avoid leaks
        // The main routine or sleep function will check death flag and exit properly
        break;
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

### 4. Enhanced the Sleep Function

Modified `philo_sleep` to check for the death flag during sleep periods, ensuring death detection even when a philosopher is sleeping or eating:

```c
void philo_sleep(t_data *data, long time)
{
    // ... existing code
    
    // Find the philosopher in the data structure by matching process ID
    // This allows us to check the death flag while sleeping
    i = 0;
    while (i < data->nbr_of_philos)
    {
        philo = &data->philos[i];
        if (philo->pid == getpid())
            break;
        i++;
    }
    
    while (1)
    {
        // Check if this is a philosopher process and if death flag is set
        // This allows us to detect death even while sleeping or eating
        // and perform proper cleanup before exiting
        if (i < data->nbr_of_philos && philo->death)
        {
            clean(data);
            exit(1);
        }
        
        // ... rest of the function
    }
}
```

### 5. Improved Parent Process Death Handling

Modified the parent process to immediately terminate all child processes when a death is detected and use a non-blocking wait approach:

```c
void *parent_death_monitor(void *arg)
{
    t_data *data = (t_data *)arg;
    
    sem_wait(data->dead);
    // Print a message to indicate death was detected by parent
    printf("Parent detected death, terminating all philosophers\n");
    fflush(stdout); // Ensure output is flushed
    // Immediately kill all child processes when death is detected
    kill_all_pid(data, data->nbr_of_philos);
    // Set a flag to indicate to the parent that we should exit
    data->full = 1; // Reusing the full flag as an exit indicator
    return NULL;
}
```

### 6. Enhanced Process Termination

Improved `kill_all_pid` to be more aggressive and reliable in terminating child processes:

```c
void kill_all_pid(t_data *data, int last)
{
  int i;

  i = 0; // Start from 0 instead of 1 to ensure we kill all processes
  if (!data || !data->pids)
    return ;
  while (i < last)
  {
    if (data->pids[i] > 0)
    {
      kill(data->pids[i], SIGKILL); // Explicitly use SIGKILL
      waitpid(data->pids[i], NULL, 0); // Wait for the process to actually terminate
    }
    i++;
  }
}
```

### 7. Non-Blocking Wait in Parent Process

Replaced the blocking `wait()` with a non-blocking approach that checks for death detection:

```c
void start_the_dinner(t_data *data)
{
    // ... existing code
    
    // Wait with timeout logic
    while (1)
    {
        // Check if death was detected
        if (data->full == 1)
        {
            break;
        }
        
        // Try to wait for any child, but don't block
        pid = waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG);
        
        // If no process status changed, sleep a short time
        if (pid == 0)
        {
            usleep(1000); // Short sleep
            continue;
        }
        
        // If error or no more children, break
        if (pid == -1)
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Final cleanup
    pthread_cancel(death_watcher); // Cancel the monitor thread
    pthread_join(death_watcher, NULL); // Wait for it to finish
    kill_all_pid(data, data->nbr_of_philos); // Final safety check
}
```

## Results

With these changes:

1. The program correctly detects philosopher deaths
2. When a death occurs, the philosopher process properly cleans up resources before exiting
3. The parent process is notified of the death via semaphore and actively terminates all child processes
4. The parent process uses non-blocking waits to prevent hanging
5. Process termination is more aggressive and reliable, using SIGKILL and waitpid
6. No memory leaks occur (except for some "possibly lost" memory due to pthread thread-local storage, which is a known Valgrind false positive)
7. The program reliably terminates after a death is detected, without any hanging issues

## Notes

The "possibly lost" memory reported by Valgrind in some runs is related to pthread's thread-local storage allocation. This is a well-known Valgrind false positive and not an actual memory leak. It occurs because Valgrind cannot fully track certain memory allocations by the pthread library, especially when processes are terminated while threads are still active.
