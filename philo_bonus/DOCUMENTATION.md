# Philosophers Program Bugfix Documentation

## Issue Description

The Philosophers program was experiencing a hanging issue when a philosopher died. The program would detect the death correctly and print the death status message, but it would not terminate properly.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root issue was in the death handling mechanism:

1. The `death_monitor` thread correctly detected a death and signaled the parent process using a semaphore.
2. However, there was no proper mechanism for the death detection to propagate to the main philosopher process routine.
3. When using a direct `exit(1)` call in the death_monitor thread, the program would terminate without proper cleanup, causing memory leaks.
4. Without an exit call, the program would hang indefinitely.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Process ID Tracking in Philosopher Structure

Modified `philo_routine` to store each philosopher's process ID, which allows other functions to identify the current philosopher:

```c
void philo_routine(t_philo *philo)
{
    pthread_t monitor;
    
    // Store process ID to identify this philosopher in other functions
    philo->pid = getpid();
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

### 2. Modified Death Detection in Main Philosopher Loop

Added a death check at the beginning of the main loop in `philo_routine`:

```c
while(1)
{
    // Check death flag at the beginning of each iteration
    // This allows for proper cleanup before exit
    if (philo->death)
    {
        clean(philo->data);
        exit(1);
    }
    // ... rest of the loop
}
```

### 3. Modified Death Monitor Thread

Changed the `death_monitor` thread to set a flag and break instead of directly exiting:

```c
void *death_monitor(void *arg)
{
    // ... existing code
    if (time_since_last_meal >= philo->data->time_to_die)
    {
        philo->death = 1;
        print_status(philo, DIED);
        sem_post(philo->data->dead);
        // Just break instead of exit to avoid leaks
        // The main routine or sleep function will check death flag and exit properly
        break;
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

### 4. Enhanced the Sleep Function

Modified `philo_sleep` to check for the death flag during sleep periods, ensuring death detection even when a philosopher is sleeping or eating:

```c
void philo_sleep(t_data *data, long time)
{
    // ... existing code
    
    // Find the philosopher in the data structure by matching process ID
    // This allows us to check the death flag while sleeping
    i = 0;
    while (i < data->nbr_of_philos)
    {
        philo = &data->philos[i];
        if (philo->pid == getpid())
            break;
        i++;
    }
    
    while (1)
    {
        // Check if this is a philosopher process and if death flag is set
        // This allows us to detect death even while sleeping or eating
        // and perform proper cleanup before exiting
        if (i < data->nbr_of_philos && philo->death)
        {
            clean(data);
            exit(1);
        }
        
        // ... rest of the function
    }
}
```

## Results

With these changes:

1. The program correctly detects philosopher deaths
2. When a death occurs, the philosopher process properly cleans up resources before exiting
3. The parent process is notified of the death via semaphore and can proceed with cleanup
4. No memory leaks occur (except for some "possibly lost" memory due to pthread thread-local storage, which is a known Valgrind false positive)
5. The program terminates correctly after a death is detected

## Notes

The "possibly lost" memory reported by Valgrind in some runs is related to pthread's thread-local storage allocation. This is a well-known Valgrind false positive and not an actual memory leak. It occurs because Valgrind cannot fully track certain memory allocations by the pthread library, especially when processes are terminated while threads are still active.
